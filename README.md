  ## Motivation
  This project is to organize personal info and to access contact info quickly.  It is best used when new members are added to a team so all the info can be quickly accessed when needed.

  Use npm inquirer package.

  ## How_to_use
  After installing npm pkg, from terminal, run node app.js to generate the prompts. Answer all prompts and after all cards are completed, an output folder will process an html file that can be viewed on a server with all the info in a card style framework.
